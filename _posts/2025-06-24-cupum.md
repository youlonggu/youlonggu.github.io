I had the pleasure of attending the 19th International Conference on Computational Urban Planning and Urban Management (CUPUM), hosted by UCL CASA. I presented our Master's research project, "A Bayesian Spatiotemporal Framework for Explaining Bus Ridership Dynamics in Singapore", developed in collaboration with Haixiao Liu, Lingsheng Lan, Yu He and supervised by Filip Biljecki, during the Smart Mobility session. I'm grateful for the thoughtful questions and feedback, which made the experience motivating and inspiring!

Beyond the presentation, it was a nice experience to attend insightful keynotes, engage in interesting discussions with fellow researchers, and enjoy a lovely dinner and a night stroll around London with my colleagues from the NUS Urban Analytics Lab.
