Today marks the end of my 2.5-year research journey at the Urban Analytics Lab (UAL). Looking back, I progressed from a part-time Research Assistant, to a research intern at the Future Cities Lab, and to a full-time Research Engineer. Throughout this journey, UAL provided me with solid research training within a productive and collaborative environment. Alongside my coursework, I had the opportunity to first-author two journal papers and two conference papers (two currently under review), and to participate in eight research projects in total, while working with inspiring colleagues and mentors who made this experience rewarding and meaningful.

All in all, this experience is an invaluable asset that I will carry with me moving forward.
